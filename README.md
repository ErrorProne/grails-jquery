jQuery Grails Plugin
=============

This is the [jQuery plugin](http://grails.org/plugin/jquery) for Grails. It adds the jQuery library to a Grails application via the `resources` or `asset-pipeline` plugins.

Anybody can contribute and releases are automated by [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/gpc/grails-jquery). Just send a pull request for the last version of jQuery and as soon as it is merged Travis will push out a new release.
